The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack Telegram Mini App for a tire and disk supplier (4tochki.ru). Initially, significant challenges were faced with the 4tochki API, particularly with the  method, which consistently returned Object reference not set errors, even with documented examples. This led to a strategic decision to build the entire application using mock data to ensure functionality and a smooth user experience. The backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) were fully implemented, including user authentication, product search (tires/disks, by car), order creation, and admin functionalities, all leveraging mock data. Later, after user provided new credentials and an XML example from 4tochki support, the  method was successfully tested and confirmed to be working with real data. The project is now ready to switch from mock data to the live 4tochki API, and deployment scripts have been prepared.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Telegram Mini App for a tire supplier (4tochki.ru). The core functionality includes searching for tires and disks by parameters and car brand, viewing prices and stock, and placing orders. Key requirements specified by the user:
-   **User Interaction**: Clients access the app via Telegram IDs/usernames.
-   **Search**: Find tires/disks by parameters and car.
-   **Pricing**: Display prices, with an admin-configurable percentage markup.
-   **Orders**: Order placement with admin confirmation before sending to the supplier. No minimum order amount or payment method selection. Delivery address input required.
-   **Supplier Anonymity**: Hide the supplier's name from customers.
-   **Visuals**: API does not provide product images; use placeholder icons.
-   **Design**: Modern, minimalist, clean UI.
-   **Scope**: Not for service stations (СТО).
-   **Domain**: The mini-app should be available at .
-   **Deployment**: A single script for installation on a hosting environment via GitHub link.
-   **API Integration**: The goal is to fully integrate the 4tochki API, but initially, mock data was used due to API issues. The app needs to switch to real API once confirmed working.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework), MongoDB (database), Zeep (SOAP client for 4tochki API), python-dotenv, python-telegram-bot.
-   **Frontend**: React.js (JavaScript library), Telegram WebApp SDK, Tailwind CSS (for styling), Lucide React (icon library).
-   **Deployment**: Supervisor (process manager), Bash scripting for installation.
-   **Data Handling**: Environment variables for configuration, Mock Data for development when external API is unavailable.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into a  (FastAPI) and  (React) directory, with supporting scripts and documentation at the root.



**Key File Modifications/Creations:**
-   : Updated with 4tochki API credentials (, ), Telegram bot token (), admin ID (), and  flag.
-   : Added , , , .
-   : Modified to integrate all new routers, initialize the Telegram bot, and set up the database connection.
-   : Implemented the Zeep client for the 4tochki SOAP API. Initially debugged issues with , later confirmed working with provided XML structure.
-   : New file created to provide placeholder data for development when the real API was problematic.
-   : All router files were created to define API endpoints and initially modified to switch between real and mock data based on .
-   : New file for in-depth API testing with XML request/response logging to debug .
-   : Updated  to  as per user's domain.
-   : Added  and .
-   : Central component, handles routing and overall layout.
-   : Updated with modern, minimalist styling.
-   : Created for centralized API calls to the backend.
-   : Component for displaying product info.
-   : All page components (HomePage, SearchPage, CarSelectionPage, CartPage, OrdersPage, AdminPage) were created to implement the user interface.
-   : Created an executable script to automate the deployment process.
-   , , , , : Created various documentation files.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Switch the backend services from using mock data to the now functional real 4tochki API.
-   Ensure the admin-configurable markup percentage functionality is fully integrated and changeable via the frontend admin panel.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved the persistent  API issues with 4tochki.ru. The user provided new API credentials (, ) and a crucial XML example for the  method from 4tochki support.

The AI engineer then:
1.  Updated the  file with the new credentials.
2.  Created a detailed API testing script () to log XML requests and responses.
3.  Executed , which confirmed that  and, most importantly,  methods now return valid data from the real 4tochki API, solving the Object reference not set error.

The current state is that the backend and frontend are fully developed with mock data, all deployment scripts and documentation are ready, and the real 4tochki API has been successfully tested and verified to be working. The AI engineer has confirmed the API is functional and is poised to integrate it.
